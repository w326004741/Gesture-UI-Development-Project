## Introduction
The project is **Universal Windows Platform(UWP) Music Player** with **[Myo Armband](https://www.myo.com/)**. Find out more about universal apps here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/whats-a-uwp. 

The project was completed using [Thalmic labs Myo Armband](https://www.myo.com/). The Myo Armband reads the electrical activity of your muscles to control technology with gestures and motion. I use [Myo Armband](https://www.myo.com/) to control the Music Player and do some functions with gestures: **Play‚ñ∂Ô∏è, Pause‚è∏, Stop‚èπ, Previous‚èÆ and Next‚è≠.**

For the music player only, the following basic functions have been implemented: **Play‚ñ∂Ô∏è, Pause‚è∏, Stop‚èπ, Previous‚èÆ, Next‚è≠, Single CycleüîÇ, Sequential LoopüîÅ, Volume Barüîä, Song Progress Barüéµ.**

## Purpose of the application
The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to use the [Myo Armband](https://www.myo.com/) to detect the electrical activity of muscles and control gestures and highly sensitive motion sensors detected by proprietary EMG muscle sensors to control the application to perform a series of operations. The [Myo Armband](https://www.myo.com/) has an **Electromyogram (EMG) sensor** that directly senses muscle activity and movement to read muscle activity in a refined manner.

This project is an example of the integration of **UWP** projects with **Myo**. It is a good demonstration of the use of Myo gesture control music player to perform a series of operations. 

**[Music Player with Myo Details(Wiki)](https://github.com/w326004741/Gesture-UI-Development-Project/wiki/Music-Player-with-Myo)** - If you want to know more details, the relevant code for this project and Myo is here.

## Gestures identified as appropriate for this application
The **Myo** is an armband equipped with several Electromyography (EMG) sensors that can recognize hand gestures and the movement of the arms.Based on the electrical impulses generated by muscles, 7 EMG sensors are responsible to recognize and perform each gesture. ![image](https://github.com/w326004741/Gesture-UI-Development-Project/blob/master/image/3031521800414_.pic.jpg)
For this project, Myo provides the following intuitive hand movements/ gestures:

#### 1. Double Tap 

The user double tap their two fingers(Thumb and Middle) and this will command the Music Player to Play Music.
#### 2. Fist

The user making a fist and the Music Player to Pause Music.
#### 3. Wave In

The user waves in (Left) their wrist and the Music Player to Play Previous Song.
#### 4. Wave Out

The user waves out (Right) their wrist and the Music Player to Play Next Song.
#### 5. Fingers Spread

The user making a fingers spread and the Music Player to Stop Music.
## Hardware used in creating the application

## Conclusions & Recommendations
This latest technology can help us to minimize the reliance on hardware and software for controlling robots and other devices. [Myo Armband](https://www.myo.com/) can easily realize the back screen control computer, in addition to playing computer games, browsing the web, controlling music entertainment and other entertainment activities, and even control the drone. Compared to [Kinect](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/kinect) and [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/?lang=en), the advantage of [Myo](https://www.myo.com/) is that it is not restricted by the specific site and it is more natural to interact. The sensor on the [Myo armband](https://www.myo.com/) is internally equipped with electrodes so that the user can read out the bioelectric activity of the muscle when the user makes a telescopic gesture, thereby determining the intention of the wearer, and then sending the result of the computer processing to the receiver via the low-power **Bluetooth** control equipment. I think that [Siri's voice](https://www.apple.com/ios/siri/) interaction is not perfect for a large number of young people who are accustomed to keyboard input and textual ideograms. In most cases, we still have a good body of limbs and are able to handle them freely. The emergence of [Myo](https://www.myo.com/) is to create new ways of interaction and make today‚Äôs everyday technology more natural and intuitive. It is clear that [Myo](https://www.myo.com/) is gradually approaching this point, gradually achieving better human-computer interaction and creating a convenient life for humans.
